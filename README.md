# jackpot_numbers
This script generates two types of random numbers and uses the secrets module and pythpon3. The data can be saved to a .txt file. 

## Fist type: 5 out of 50
5 random numbers out of a range from 1 to 50.

## Second type: 2 out of 10
2 random numbers out of a range from 1 to 10.

# Statistics 
The generated numbers are compared to thier frequency in the past lottery wins. If the "genartor.py" wont work use "generator_without_website.py". This file doesn't have the statistic features.
